Build a responsive web app (Next.js + React + TypeScript preferred, but plain React is fine) called “Palette”.
This is an MVP UI for a renovation visualization + cost estimator. The app is single-page and keeps both user-uploaded images visible throughout.

CORE USER GOAL
- Upload a photo of their space and an inspiration photo.
- Choose a budget tier (Budget / Mid-range / Luxury).
- Click “Generate design + estimate”.
- See: (1) a fixed “After” image result, (2) a “What we applied” explanation, (3) a cost estimate range, (4) a materials vs labor breakdown table by category, and (5) 3 upgrade tips + 3 cost-saving tips.

IMPORTANT UI BEHAVIOR
- The two uploaded images should display as thumbnails at the top and remain visible at all times after upload.
- The “After” result is a single fixed image (no before/after toggle).
- The “What we applied” text panel should sit side-by-side with the “After” image, visually equal weight.
- The budget tier selection happens before generation.
- Add helper text under budget tiers explaining what “Mid-range” generally means.
- Below the estimate, show a table that splits each category into Materials, Labor, Total, plus a Labor Subtotal row and Total Estimate row.
- At the bottom, show two text sections:
  - “If You Wanted to Spend ~10% More” with top 3 upgrade recommendations.
  - “If You Needed to Save ~10%” with top 3 cost reduction recommendations.

MVP IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
- Implement the UI first with mocked “generation” output. No real AI calls required.
- When user clicks “Generate design + estimate”, simulate an async call (e.g., 1–2 seconds) and then populate the output sections with placeholder content.
- If either image is missing, disable the generate button.
- Allow the user to change the budget tier and re-generate (refresh output).

PAGE LAYOUT (DESKTOP)
Header: “Palette” + tagline “Where your style meets your space”.
Top row: two upload cards side-by-side:
  - Left: “Your Space” upload (image preview after upload)
  - Right: “Inspiration Photo” upload (image preview after upload)
Below: budget tier radio buttons:
  - Budget / Mid-range (recommended) / Luxury
  - Helper text: “Mid-range typically reflects semi-custom materials, upgraded finishes, and standard professional labor.”
Below: primary CTA button “Generate design + estimate”.
Main content (appears after generation):
  - Two-column row:
    - Left: “Transformed Design” (After image placeholder)
    - Right: “What We Applied” panel with bullet points
  - Then: “Estimated Project Cost (Selected Tier)” with a prominent range (e.g., $27,500 – $33,000) and one sentence disclaimer.
  - Then: “Cost Breakdown” table with columns: Category | Materials | Labor | Total
    Rows:
      - Cabinets / Built-ins
      - Finishes
      - Fixtures & Lighting
      - Labor Subtotal
      - Total Estimate
  - Then: two columns:
    - Left: “If You Wanted to Spend ~10% More” bullets 1–3
    - Right: “If You Needed to Save ~10%” bullets 1–3

DATA MODEL (frontend state)
- spaceImage: File | null
- inspoImage: File | null
- budgetTier: "budget" | "mid" | "luxury" (default "mid")
- isGenerating: boolean
- result: null | {
    afterImageUrl: string (for MVP you can reuse the inspiration image or a static placeholder URL),
    whatApplied: string[] (bullets),
    estimateRange: { low: number, high: number, currency: "USD" },
    breakdown: Array<{
      category: string,
      materialsLow: number, materialsHigh: number,
      laborLow: number, laborHigh: number,
      totalLow: number, totalHigh: number
    }>,
    laborSubtotal: { low: number, high: number },
    upgradeTips: string[3],
    savingsTips: string[3]
  }

PLACEHOLDER CONTENT (use these by default after generation)
- What we applied bullets:
  1) “Warm, mid-tone wood materials”
  2) “Reduced visual weight in upper areas”
  3) “Matte black fixtures & hardware”
  4) “Soft neutral wall color”
  5) “Layout, windows, and flooring were preserved.”
- Mid-range estimate range: $27,500 – $33,000
- Breakdown rows (example):
  - Cabinets/Built-ins: materials $8k–$10k, labor $4k–$5k, total $12k–$15k
  - Finishes: materials $2.5k–$3.5k, labor $1.5k–$2k, total $4k–$6k
  - Fixtures & Lighting: materials $2k–$2.5k, labor $1k–$1.5k, total $3k–$4k
  - Labor subtotal: $8k–$10k
  - Total estimate: $27,500–$33,000
- Upgrade tips (spend ~10% more):
  1) “Upgrade cabinet door styles / fronts for the biggest visual return.”
  2) “Add one statement light fixture or standout hardware set.”
  3) “Upgrade one focal surface finish (e.g., backsplash tile or wall finish).”
- Savings tips (save ~10%):
  1) “Opt for stock cabinetry or simpler construction while keeping the same layout.”
  2) “Reduce custom built-ins or millwork in non-focal areas.”
  3) “Simplify fixture selections while preserving placement and layout.”

STYLING GUIDELINES
- Clean, minimal, lots of whitespace.
- Use a centered max width (e.g., 1100–1200px).
- Card-style containers with light borders and subtle shadow.
- Make the estimate range prominent (large font).
- Table should be legible and aligned.

DELIVERABLES
- Implement the full UI + mocked generation behavior.
- Include basic accessibility: labels for file inputs, keyboard-friendly radio buttons, disabled state on generate button, and loading state (spinner or text).
